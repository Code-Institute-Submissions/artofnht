### Project Scope
#### User Objectives
* The user is searching for an artist to commission work.
* The user is searching for comic art to buy.
* The user is browsing comic art sites for inspiration.

#### User Demographics
* The primary users of the site will be comic art fans. The demographics of comic art fans are quite wide - male and female from ages 5 up to 60 who have an appreciation for comic art.
* A simple, colorful and attractive design would fit this demographic. As the demographic is particularly interested in art and design, the site needs to reflect this and an attractive, vibrant and modern design is of high importance.

#### Functional Requirements
* The user needs to be able to see a portfolio of the artist's work.
* The user requires contact information to enable them to contact the artist.
* The user potentially requires pricing information. It was decided during the initial stategy meeting with the client that pricing information would not be disclosed on the website, but would be provided on request.

#### Constraints
* Developer skill set - the developer is currently unable to develop an online sales capability, but this may be considered for future development phases.
* The client is reluctant to create a social media presence on facebook, instagram etc, but does have an artist page on https://www.comicartfans.com/ which should be linked to.
* The client has time constaints on the amount of work he can produce as he has a full time job. For this reason, we discussed and decided to incorporate a Subscribe button to the about page, which would allow the artist to produce art and then contact a mailing list of prospective buyers. 

#### Business rules
* Copyright notices - all comic book characters are copyright of their respective owners. Copyright notice should appear on each page in the footer.

Further wireframes showing different options for the Home and Gallery pages were produced using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/index.html) and presented to the client.

For the initial design, The home page will feature 2 large bright and colorful illustrations, a navigation menu, the NHT logo provided by the client and a link to https://www.comicartfans.com/. We decided to use two illustations as the artist's best and most colourful illustrations are portrait orientation and this would allow 2 images to be tiled side by side on a desktop view, with one of the images being removed or the images being tiled vertically on smaller devices. 

The Gallery will be initially presented as a section of the home page, to allow for simple linear navigation through the most important content on the site. The gallery will feature the artist's favourite pictures divided into the categories "Illustrations" and "Caricatures". The images will be tiled in 2 rows corresponding to the "Illustrations" and "Caricatures" categories, with 3 columns on a desktop view, 2 columns on a tablet view and 1 column on a mobile view.

The Biography and Contact information will be presented on the About NHT page. A Subscribe button will also be provided.
